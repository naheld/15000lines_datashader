Application for Visualization of Marine Metaproteomics Data
This respository provides scripts and example data for the datashader application described in "Harnessing the power of Scientific Python to Investigate Metaproteomes and Biogeochemistry of the Central Pacific Ocean" (Proceedings of the 17th Python in Science Conference, 2018) by Noelle Held, Jaclyn Saunders, Joe Futrelle, and Mak Saito.

Installing and running the application
The application is organized in a Jupyter notebook.

This application makes use of Bokeh (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh),  pandas (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), holoviews (https://github.com/ioam/holoviews) and datashader (https://github.com/bokeh/datashader). It is important to use the exact version of Bokeh in particular; see enviornment.yml.
